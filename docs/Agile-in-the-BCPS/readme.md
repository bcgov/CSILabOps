# Agile in the BC Public Service

Public servants are seeking ways to better deliver services that meet citizen expectations in a complex, fast-changing world. This means abandoning traditional approaches, which often assume:

* we can predict the outcomes of our work over long periods of time, 
* manage complexity with increasingly large and complex projects, and 
* know people's needs without talking to them. 

It also means re-training and gaining competency in new mindset and methods that enable us to navigate change and new opportunties. With  an "Agile" approach, teams can to respond to unpredictable change through:

* starting small,
* building, or iterating on, direct feedback from users on prototypes and real products or services we build; and
* taking an incremental approach to delivery that reduces the risk we manage at any given time.

If applied appropriately, Agile practices usually yield better results for citizens through faster and more efficient service delivery. This, according to the [Corporate HR Plan](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/forms-tools/all-employees/corporate_plan_where_ideas_work.pdf "Corporate HR Plan"), is why the BC Public Service is investing in learning how to apply agile methods, where traditional approaches are not meeting citizen expectations.

The Exchange Lab is one place where public servants learn to be Agile. The lab incubates and accelerates learning through the experience of delivering high quality services. While we build real products, the higher value deliverable is the talent and team that becomes equipped to continue service improvement, while taking on new important challenges.

### There is a way to do this with ill-effect.

Agile is considered "new" to many, but it has been used in the technology industry since at least the 1990s. It has surged in popularily among public services across Canada and more broadly. This means there are many flavours of adoption, and not all are successful.

Expecting a new team or organization to simply adopt Agile methodologies is like asking an African Safari guide to lead Scuba divers on a reef tour. There are some core competencies that need to be adopted before this can happen. 

Further, service delivery in complex circumstances, regardless of methodology, is still difficult. Agile teams require the right conditions to succeed.
  
## From Bridges to Software to Public Service

Agile has its roots in Lean manufacturing and became popular in the software industry. Traditional project management made sense for engineering projects, but challenges surfaced for software development. In particular,  traditional or waterfall project management limits our ability to adapt to changing requrements because of structures that force alignment to long term plans. 

Additonally, when we create isolated and specialized teams in project structures, we require cascading hand-offs which challenge communication and collaboration. This limits innovation, slows delivery of value, and degrades the quality of our products.

In 2015, we started experimenting with Agile product teams. We learned about the value of an [Agile Delivery Process](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Agile-Delivery-Journey?intention=LOGIN#error=login_required "Agile Delivery Process")  and culture, including:
  * Iteration
  * Team collaboration and communication
  * User feedback
  * Incremental delivery
  * Small autonomous teams
  * Bringing developers and operations closer together (DevOps)
  * Openness, transparency and community

The positive results are evident: there are over [12 product teams](https://bcgov.github.io/ExchangeLabOps/Resident-Teams/README.html) who have delivered high quality products in an Agile way and many within a year. Additionally, organizations that have graduated teams from the Lab are now embarking on broader Agile adoption and are creating more teams.

The demand for support from across the Public Service to become more Agile is increasing. While the Exchange Lab uses Agile-Scrum methodologies, there is interest in applying Agile values and principles more broadly. There is a growing community of people supporting each other to learn how to apply scrum and other methods.

## Agile Practices

Why do some organizations struggle to become agile?

There are structures and resulting culture that prevent agile practices. These are hard to change and we're all learning to do this together. There are some specific competencies and practices that organizations can start working on right away. Servant leaders at the executive level supporting autonomous teams is key.

Tips to get started:

* Work in the open: Share information that would not normally be out there and invite feedback. [See the government of Canada's Guide for Publishing Open Source Code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html)
* Talk to your users directly, ideally citizens receiving services.
* Use modern tools and technology that support automation.

### If you're interested in Agile Scrum in the BCPS, here are some things to know:

#### Teams
Agile Scrum Teams are made up of 5 to 9 dedicated team members, with at least 2 full time government staff
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Development team

#### Team Procurement
We value working with our tech sector partners who offer additional experience and innovation. Procure a team that is equipped to work in an Agile way using [Sprint With Us](https://www.bcdevexchange.org/sprintwithus).
