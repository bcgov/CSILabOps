# Governance for Agile Product Teams
When it comes to governance, we receive two types of questions:
1. How can an organization support Agile teams with appropriate governance; and
2. How do you fit Agile teams into existing governance structures in traditional organization models.

Both questions are fair, but the first question often leads to a more productive conversation.

Ultimately, if we are building Agile teams, we should be focused on how to help them get results. These teams are full-time and focused on solving for user's needs and deliver value more quickly than traditional (waterfall) methods. They have a high burn rate on resources, but they manage risk in small increments, so they require quick feedback cycles. The governance needs to be equally responsive.

The second question assumes that an Agile team can work with a traditional governance structure. This might include multiple levels of approval designed to slow decision making. This governance design is effective where high levels of **known** risk require management across an enterprise. While this is a helpful and required structure for a variety of public sector functions, it is not effective for Agile teams. 

Agile is appropriately applied when we are solving complex problems where risks to effective delivery are **unknown** until we receive feedback from end users.

## High bureaucracy reflects low trust and slows down learning.

If your organization is seeking to deliver using agile methods, then we'd expect a focus on building high performing teams. These teams are empowered to manage their work in ways that shrink risks associated with decisions through iterative and incremental work. They require quick feedback loops for learning.

If you are trying to create these teams, you should be adjusting your governance model or executive leadership expectations and behaviours. Otherwise, your investment in the talent and delivery will not be optimized. You may also be at risk of creating an aversion to agile methods overall, as people new to this way of working may abandon it out of frustration without the right governance conditions.
