# Governance for Agile Product Teams
We get a lot of questions about how to support Agile teams with appropriate goverance. We also get questions about how to fit Agile teams into existing governance structures in the traditional models.

Both questions are fair, but the first question often leads to a more productive conversation. Ultimately, if we are building Agile teams, we should be focused on how to help them get results. While these teams deliver value more quickly than traditional (waterfall) methods, they also have a high burn rate on resources, because they are full-time and focused on solving for users needs. The governance needs to be equally responsive to work that is managed to reduce the risk associated with each decision.

The second question assumes that an Agile team can work with a traditional governance structure. This might includes multiple levels of approval designed to slow decision making where high levels of known risk require assessment and management across an enterprise. While this is a helpful and required structure for a variety of public sector functions, there is a need to create alternative strucutres when we are solving complex problems where risks to effective delivery are unknown until we receive feedback from end users.

## High bureaucracy reflects low trust and slows down learning.

If your organization is seeking to deliver using agile methods, then we'd expect a focus on high performing teams. These teams are empowered to manage their work in ways that shrink risks assocaited with decisions through iterative and incremental work. They require quick feedback loops for learning.

If you are trying to create these teams, you should be adjusting your governance model or executive leadership expectations and behaviours. Otherwise, your investment in the talent and the delivery will not be optimized. You may also be at risk of creating an aversion to agile methods overall, as people new to this way of working may abandon it out of frustration without the right governance conditions.
