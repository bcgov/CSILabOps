# Learning

Our team creates and offers learning programs to support agencies to build the structures and competencies that enable better service delivery through digital government. 

The methods and tools used for delivery at the Lab are largely new to to the BC Public Service, but have been used with success in other governments and sectors. We apply a specific approach, called Agile, to foster high performing teams that focus and deliver products in short time frames through iterative development. We also expect continuous service improvement and new approaches to technology, specifically DevOps practices.

The language and culture that has developed around these approaches is new and can be disorienting if you have not made the effort to learn.

All of the programs at the Exchange Lab are designed to facilitate learning this new way of working. In particular, we offer the following:

## Community - Broad and specific to people who are learning new roles.

The work we do is complex. Rather than relying on multiple layers of committees to review, approve or direct our work, we enagage with the community around us to discover the best possible way to solve problems. 

Learn more about the communities you can participate in by [checking out events](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/events) or [connect with them in Rocket.Chat, our community messaging tool](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Steps-to-join-Pathfinder-Rocket.Chat).

## Delivery - Through a year long residency in the Lab, or through coaching.

Delivery teams at the Lab earn a residency through establishing a specific problem they are trying to solve, and by getting their organization aligned to the digital delivery approach we support. If you think your organization would benefit from a year long residency, please read about the Journey of a Lab Team.

## How we develop our programs

Programs created at the Lab are done so in collaboration with individuals across the BC Public Service, and in some cases, include  materials or contributions from other jursidictions.

We also promote and offer training from other organizations and vendors that has been tested and accepted to be aligned with the BC Public Service's approach to digital.

*Do you know of some excellent training we should point people to?* Please let us know at [ExchangeLab@gov.bc.ca](mailto:exchangelab@gov.bc.ca "Email ExchangeLab@gov.bc.ca").
