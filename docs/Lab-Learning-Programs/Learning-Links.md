# Links to Our Favourite Learning Resources
We've curated a few of our favourite links for you to enjoy. There's plenty more to explore out there, but this might just get you started and hungry for more!

## Product Owner in a Nutshell
-->  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE)  <--

Learn about the typical experience of a Product Owner in an ideal Agile Scrum team situation. This is important for government teams to watch because Henrik does a wonderful job explaining the typical challenges we face with decision making and productivity. He illustrates nicely why the role of "Product OWner" is so valuable, and some of the challenges they experience.

## Agile in the BC Public Service - The Mines Digital Service Team Experience
Have a hard time believing we can do this in the BC Public Service? Well, suspend your disbelief! Here is the real-life story of a very successful Agile Product Team that is building software that is highly valued by their internal and external to government users.

## Working in the Open
Some people have a hard time believing that working in the open - putting draft content in a public space - is okay or worthwhile. It is! So long as the content is not sensitive and does not contain private information, working in the open creates opportunities for collaboration, contribution and reduced duplication.

We like the Government of Canada's [Guide for Publishing Open Source Code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html) as an example of appropriate standards for public bodies on this.

For a good example of what this looks like, [check out this tweet thread from the Canadian Digial Service.](https://twitter.com/CDS_GC/status/1227971000471560197?s=20)

## Wardelypedia - Strategy and Doctrine for Agile Organizations
How does an organization move towards being adaptable enough to change its practices? We've been using Simon Wardely's open source guidance and strategy tools to support our efforts.

In particular, check out his [Doctrine Patterns for building a healthy organization.](http://wardleypedia.org/mediawiki/index.php/Doctrine_Patterns)
