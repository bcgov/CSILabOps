# Phase 0: Desire a new way of working

Have you been working towards delivering value in your organization and feel that the systems or process are challenging your ability to get results? Particularly when there is technology involved?

Maybe it's time to step back and consider some new ways of working. Your friends at the Exchange lab have done that, and are having lots of learning, success, and fun. We're keen to share.

* <a href="/ExchangeLabOps/One-Pager_Journey-of-an-Exchange-Lab-Team.pdf">Learn about the full Journey of a Team.</a>
* [Learn more about the Agile process](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Agile-Delivery-Process/Agile-Delivery-Process)

All of the programs at the lab are designed to facilitate learning. In particular, we offer the following
* Training - Delivered for a variety of experience levels.
* Community - Broad and specific to people who are learning new roles and methods.
* Delivery - Through a year long residency in the Lab, or through coaching.

## Intake to the Residency Program
