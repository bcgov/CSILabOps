# Phase 2: Build a Minimum Viable Product

During this phase, a new team starts working on the proof of concept they have imagined as a result of what was discovered in phase 1.

The process includes building an Alpha product to test with users (this may even be paper prototypes) and then moving towards a beta product that is working software.

Lab Operations support teams through this with coaching, facilitation and support to use modern tools.
