# The Journey of a Lab Team

The primary program delivered by the Exchange Lab is a year long residency for a Team. These teams typically do not exist before an organization approaches the Lab for help. 

We support public servants to understand the value of building high performing teams that build a product and continue to improve it. These teams use Agile methods to quickly and effectively build services that meet people's needs. We know, because the talk directly to the people who use the products!

# Expected Timeline

Not every journey is the same, but given what we have seen to be possible when the right conditions are in place, here is want you can expect from a digital delivery team in the Lab:
___

>**Within a month**, program areas build a team and align their organizaton to support Agile delivery.

>**Within two months**, teams clarify the problem they are trying to solve.

>**Within three months**, teams build a prototype and engage directly with users to learn what is most important to them.

>**Within four months**, teams release a real digital product (considered an alpha product) to users and build trust in their organization that they are making solid progress. They can communicate their "velocity" and have high trust and productivity.

>**Within six months**, teams refine the product by getting feedback directly from users. They start coaching other teams and offering solutions back to the community.

>**Within eight months**, teams are ready to release a beta product to the public. They have solid infrastructure and technical excellence so that they can quickly respond to changing requirements or unexpected issues. Vendor team mates coach new public service talent that will remain in the team. 

>**Within a year**, teams are ready to graduate. The product is ready for a live status and ongoing improvements in a stable production environment. The home organization is capable of supporting the ongoing productivity of the team, with new problems to solve.

## How to get started

We've outlined the main phases that teams go through on this site and are providing resources and tools that teams need during these different phases. 

If you know of a resource that we should add or build, please contact <ExchangeLab@gov.bc.ca>.
