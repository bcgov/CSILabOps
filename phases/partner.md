Is your service delivery program ready to apply the Digital Principles and mindset and methods of Agile product development?

Programs that partner with the Exchange Lab demonstrate a **need for acceleration** towards this new way of working and they are **ready for the challenge.**

Prior to partnering with the Exchange, a program area must demonstrate they are:

- **Solving a real problem:** Enough service analytics and/or user research has confirmed the users needs requires development of a new product.
- **Priority for the Ministry:** receives funding, requires timely delivery, is connected to mandate, and generally has the attention of the senior executive.
- **Complex:** requires focused attention to define the problem and explore and test solutions using Agile methods.
- **Digital:** requires a digital or online expression (this may also lead to policy and procedure changes) or advances broader government digital objectives.
- **Broadly valued:** includes at least one business capability that serves the needs of other program areas, such that the product built can be leveraged by others.
- **Continuous:** will deliver value into the foreseeable future, such that a program will dedicate a team to continuously improve the product after it leaves the Lab.

Explore what happens in each of the phases a program goes through during partnership with the Exchange.

## Timeline

Not every journey is the same, but given what we have seen to be possible when the right conditions are in place, here is want you can expect from a digital delivery team in the lab:

**Within a month**, program areas build a team and align their organization to support Agile delivery.

**Within two months**, teams clarify the problem they are trying to solve.

**Within three months**, teams build a prototype and engage directly with users to learn what is most important to them.

**Within four months**, teams release a real digital product (considered an alpha product) to users and build trust in their organization that they are making solid progress. They can communicate their "velocity" and have high trust and productivity.

**Within six months**, teams refine the product by getting feedback directly from users. They start coaching other teams and offering solutions back to the community.

**Within eight months**, teams are ready to release a beta product to the public. They have solid infrastructure and technical excellence so that they can quickly respond to changing requirements or unexpected issues. Vendor team mates coach new public service talent that will remain in the team.

**Within a year**, teams are ready to graduate. The product is ready for a live status and ongoing improvements in a stable production environment. The home organization is capable of supporting the ongoing productivity of the team, with new problems to solve.

## Key Resources

#### Before you call us: Challenge Brief Template

<a href="resources\2021-02_Challenge-Brief_Template.pdf" target="_blank"><img height="165" width="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="assets\img\coverpage_challenge-brief.png" alt="cover page illustration of the challenge brief document"></a>

When potential partners call for help, we always ask:
> "What do you think the problem is you need to solve?"

> "Who are you solving the problem(s) for?"

> "What have you done to inspect the nature of the problem(s)?"

> "What permission and capacity do you have to address the problem with so far?"

We don't want your business requirements document (unless we are having a bon fire.) Bring us the most succinct explanation of why this complex problem is important and why you are stuck and need help. Ideally, complete a "Challenge brief" so that we can circulate this insight to our Digital Delivery Network partners.
