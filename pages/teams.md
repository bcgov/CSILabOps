**Teams from Across the BC Public Service Learn to be Digital at the Exchange Lab**

The Exchange Lab hosts Agile product delivery teams that learn to be digital through experience. Teams of 5-9 people to learn how to work with DevOps methods and tools and deliver multiple iterative releases of high quality public value products within a year for, typically, lower cost than traditional methods. These high performing teams then continue to support their home organizations with digital delivery capacity and culture.

Ideally, they go on to address other program needs with new products, or they hive off other teams to increase capacity and grow a portfolio of excellent service delivery products.

This is a brief overview of the teams that are currently in the lab or in the process of onboarding. You can also learn about:
- [Alumni Teams](/ExchangeLabOps/alumni-teams)
- [Teams outside the lab we cheer on](/ExchangeLabOps/other-teams)

## BC Registries

The ServiceBC team is developing a number of Registry products. The Names Examination
application verifies if a company name is available for use in BC. Cooperatives in B.C. will soon be
able to file reports securely online: a faster, simpler way than the previous paper mail-in process.
The new application will leverage the BC Services Card and PayBC for credit card payments.

## Cloud Pathfinder

This team is part of the BCDevExchange and is working with the Platform Services team to extend application hosting services from on premise cloud to include public cloud offerings. The team is building the onboarding process and supporting services to enable easy onboarding to cloud.

* [See the Cloud Pathfinder code on Github](https://github.com/bcgov/cloud-pathfinder)

## Common Components

The Common Components team is working on ways to reduce the time and cost of delivering digital products and services. The user-focused team plans to achieve this by making it easy to find, onboard to and use components like code and microservices that solve common problems. Several teams across the BC Public Service are creating reusable digital building blocks that can be used across government and the Common Components team is working to amplify these teams’ important work. Where gaps and unmet needs are found, the team will fill them, seeking wherever possible to reuse components from other jurisdictions or the open source community.

## Digital Trust

**Also known as Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) and Orgbook**

OrgBook BC is a searchable public directory of open verifiable data about organizations legally registered in BC. BC businesses are now empowered with a locally-issued trusted digital identity
that can be used globally. The Province of BC is leveraging open source decentralized identity
technology and collaborating with global experts to create this new capability.
