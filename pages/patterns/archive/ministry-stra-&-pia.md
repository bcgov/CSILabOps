### Ministry STRA & PIA Pattern
Describes a set of steps to allow your team to start your STRA and PIA journey.
- Project team contacts the [Information Privacy and Security Team](mailto:CITZ Security and Privacy CITZ:EX %3cSecurityandPrivacy.Citz@gov.bc.ca%3e) (IPS) to seek advice and initiate the assessment process.
- IPS collects information from the project team to provide an initial recommendation regarding assessment approach and scope.
- IPS works together with the project team, and other key stakeholders as needed, to conduct the assessment.
- Project team supports the process by providing all relevant information and documentation to IPS in order to conduct the assessment.
- IPS liaises with core government information privacy and security branches (i.e., the Privacy, Compliance and Training Branch (PCT) and the Information Security Branch (ISB)) throughout the process, including during the assessment ‘sign-off’ phase.
