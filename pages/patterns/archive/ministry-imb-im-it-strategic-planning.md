### Ministry IMB IM/IT Strategic Planning Pattern
How the IMB will work with your division/business unit for IM/IT initiatives and enquiries.

- IMB has dedicated Senior Business Consultantsâ€™ for every Division, and we want to help you through the challenges and successes to meet your goals/objectives.  
    - Please contact your Division [Senior Business Consultant](https://intranet.gov.bc.ca/thehub/ocio/ocio-enterprise-services/imb).
- The IMB works together with our internal team, and other key stakeholders as needed, to review the enquiry and help you through every step of your journey.
- The team will do a comprehensive review as to your needs and requirements and try to align you with the best tools and the Ministry objectives.
- An agreed upon response to the enquiry is reached and your Senior Business Consultant will follow up with you to guide you through the next steps of the journey.
- Our goal is to set out a clear objectives and actions that will be determined the best outcome of the review.
