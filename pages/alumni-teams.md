Teams that partner with the lab typically have a year long residency to build their team and a beta product. Once they are ready to announce a live product, they transition out of the lab. The intention is to have built the organization's capacity to support the team by this time.

Some of the product teams listed are evolved from teams that started in the lab and are now building the next product in their portfolio.

## BC Biodiversity Hub

The objectives for the BioHubBC project are to:

- provide a single source for aquatic and terrestrial species and habitat data.
- reduce the barriers for collecting and sharing aquatic and terrestrial species and habitat data throughout the province of British Columbia.
- reduce the effort involved with managing aquatic and terrestrial species and habitat data.
- improve access for all stakeholders to the aquatic and terrestrial species and habitat data needed to make informed decisions and policies for the province.

This team is an extension/continuation of the [Invasive Species team](#invasive-species) that partnered with the lab.

## DataBC

DataBC is a partner that supports the Digital Delivery network with data products and services. They resided in the Lab for a time to enable connection with new product teams and to transition their existing operations to adopt Agile practices, while improving their products based on what they were learning from the community,

[Check out DataBC's services including](https://www.data.gov.bc.ca/):
- Data Catalogue (including open data)
- BC Map services and spatial data infrastructure
- Location services, including Geocoder

## Digital Marketplace

The team behind the initial creation of the Exchange Lab (formerly CSI Lab), the BCDevExchange modernizes how government delivers services. They created the flagship apps: "Code With Us" and "Sprint with Us." This branch of the Office of the Chief Information Officer models a modern Public Service by building & supporting teams that apply the culture, processes, business models and technology of the digital era to solving public challenges.

## Environmental Assessment

EPIC (EAO Project Information and Collaboration) provides citizens, Indigenous groups and
stakeholders access to centralized information and the ability to participate in and provide
feedback on environmental assessments. The tool also simplifies business processes for staff.

## Invasive Species

Conservation is a key outcome for this team building tools to support invasive species
management. The open source code will be a foundation for managing other types of species
and ecosystem data in the future.

## Mines Digital Service (MDS)

This dual team has built scalable, open source, data-driven systems, including a platform for
ministry staff that is intuitive and capable of providing meaningful data. They are also building
a public portal – Minespace – allows mines to self-report electronically.

## MSP Forms

One of the first products to be supported by the BCDevExchange, the MSP application was a
simple solution to a costly problem: a 40% error rate in MSP forms. People seeking health care in
BC experience form errors less than 2% of the time now. The open code for this product was also
reused to produce an application that enables more efficient FOI process.

## MyRangeBC

The Range program built an app with the BCDevExchange's Mobile Pathfinder that enables
offline collection and management of data about crown lands used for livestock range. The open
source tool supports sustainable management of herds and the wild plants they rely on.

## Public Review and Comment

Public review and comment is the way the government collects public input on proposed
activities on crown land as part of the decision-making process. The team created a service, now
called the "Application, Comment and Reason for Decision" (ACRFD) app that improved the way
people learn about and provide comments on proposed activities.

## Transportation Fuel Reporting System

The Transportation Fuels Reporting System facilitates online Fuel Reporting and Low Carbon Fuel Credit Trading supporting BC’s market-based approach to avoiding lifecycle GHG emissions from transportation fuel.

## Water

This team first built Groundwater wells (GWELLS): a registry application for industry, academia, governments and the general public who submit or use groundwater data and information. The team is now onto their second product outside of the Exchange Lab: a water information data visualization service that enables robust and defensible water resource decisions.
