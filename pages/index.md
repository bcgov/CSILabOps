We are known as a **lab** and a **community** of people who are learning how to improve service delivery in the BC Public Service.

We are also the home of the [BC Developers' Exchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/), known for producing innovative procurement tools ([Code with Us and Sprint with Us](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace)) and **a thriving community of GovTech designers and developers.**

This website guides expectations for how The Exchange Lab operates and makes our methods and tools open for others to use.

## Our Mission
Government, through the BC Public Service, can be trusted to respond to change and meet peoples' expectations for excellent service delivery. A [modern public service](http://whereideaswork.gov.bc.ca/modern/) that embraces digital mindset and practices is one way to achieve this mission.

To  Exchange Lab partners with government programs to deliver high quality, modern services by supporting people to learn and apply the best available design and delivery methods, tools, and technology.

**The results we seek center around:**
- Creating high performing, cross functional teams.
- Delivering high value public impact through excellent digital products and services.
- Maximizing the return on public funding to modernize the public service through technology investment, policy improvement, community building and organizational development.
- Connecting an ecosystem of public service oriented people and agencies - inside the BC Government and beyond.

## Delivery Model

We apply BC's [Digital Principles](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-principles/) and generally accepted modern [standards for service design and delivery](/standard), pioneered and practiced by other government digital service agencies around the world.

The Exchange Lab operates within a model of continuous improvement, centered around a value chain that delivers **teams**. Explore the phases of Exchange Lab residency and the variety of resources we produce to support teams in each phase:
1. [Apply to the Lab](https://github.com/HeatherRemacle/exchangelabops/blob/master/phases/apply.md)
2. [Align Your Org](https://github.com/HeatherRemacle/exchangelabops/blob/master/phases/align.md)
3. [Resource a Team](https://github.com/HeatherRemacle/exchangelabops/blob/master/phases/resource.md)
4. [Onboard & Discover](https://github.com/HeatherRemacle/exchangelabops/blob/master/phases/discover.md)
5. [Deliver a Product](https://github.com/HeatherRemacle/exchangelabops/blob/master/phases/deliver.md)
6. [Sustain Practices](https://github.com/HeatherRemacle/exchangelabops/blob/master/phases/align.md/sustain)

We continuously refine and adapt lab operations to the specific context of program areas we partner with. **There is no single, consistent path.** We operate in high degrees of complexity and create the conditions for a positive, productive trajectory through the application of:
- experimentation;
- collaboration; and
- emergent practices and standards.

## Delivery Community

**A community of people committed to learning and building public impact value together is essential to our mission.**

The Exchange Lab is an anchor in a broader **"Digital Delivery Network"** that we refer to as a community. It also includes a variety of specific communities that may be sharing practices, mentorship, or specific supports related to digital tools, such as the DevOps platform.

### Delivery Teams

Agile product delivery teams are most successful when they plug into the Digital Delivery Network and communities that are relevant to their practices. The Exchange Lab team actively connects these teams to eachother as well, so they can share learning and solve common problems together.

### Delivery Partners (corporate services and products)

Underlying the success of these teams are a variety of centralized services, common components, or platforms for building excellent services. The Exchange Lab supports connection to these agencies, which include:

- [Accessibility](https://gww.gov.bc.ca/groups/accessibility-bc-public-service) – working to make accessibility part of the DNA of the public – both in the digital and physical environments.
- [BC Behavioural Insights Group](https://gww.gov.bc.ca/groups/bc-behavioural-insights-group-big) – applying behavioural science to behaviour-based policy problems by making small tweaks or “nudges” to a program or service.
- [ Corporate Privacy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy) – supporting employees in balancing their need to collect and share personal information while meeting their privacy obligations.
- [Data](https://gww.gov.bc.ca/groups/data-science-community-practice) – supporting employees to develop their ability to collect, manage, share, analyse, interpret and present data.
- [DevOps](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/BC-Government-OpenShift-Container-Platform-Service-Definition) – enabling BC Public Service digital delivery teams to fully control the deployment of their applications.
- [Innovation Hub](https://gww.gov.bc.ca/groups/innovation-hub) – supporting a more innovative workplace culture by inspiring and empowering employees to reimagine their work now and into the future.
- [LeanBC](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/lean-bc) – improving business processes, from the simple to the complex, and reducing red tape for citizens and businesses across British Columbia.
- [Service & Content Design ](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/service-design#:~:text=Service%20Design%20in%20B.C.,%2C%20education%2C%20policy%20and%20finance.)– improving how citizens find, access and use government services by performing human-centred design research with citizens and stakeholders in B.C.
- [Analytics](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/web-content-development-guides/analytics) - using digital tooling and business process to enable assessment of the success people have using services from end-to-end.

### Delivery Community Channels

Guidance and playbooks can aid some of the work we do. However, conditions change so rapidly and delivery contexts are too diverse for any ordered list to remain relevant. The evolving knowledge shared by the community is how we keep pace while learning how to be successful in navigating the complexity of people and technology.

The Delivery Network uses a variety of channels to connect. The MS Teams channel internal to the BC Public Service is very active, as is [Rocket.Chat](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/home), which is available to external partners who are authenticated as part of a team in our BCGov Github organization.
