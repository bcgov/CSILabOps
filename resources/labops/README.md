# Resources for Operating the Lab

As best we can, we share the practices we employ at the Exchange Lab, so that others might be able to contribute to our operations, or to apply our practices and find success in their own context.

#### Warning: almost nothing we do is static or consistent. 

> While the competencies and materials we employ and that you find here might be discernable and repeatable, being adaptable, responsive, and creative as we solve problems is embedded in the meaning behind our practices. This is appropriate for our practices which have grown to exist within high degrees of compexity (human systems), diversity, and constant change. Our practices might not fit your context.
